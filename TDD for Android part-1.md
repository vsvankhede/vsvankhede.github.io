This is an introductory part of TDD for Android series. In this first part you will find why I've decided to follow TDD for Android application.

If you are regular Android dev conference attendee(or watching dev con videos) then you might have found that people in dev conference and meetups are talking about TDD in Android.

I was wondering that how much TDD can be helpful in Android to deliver the higher quality application while making developer life easier. After watching many conference videos and reading many blogs I decided to spend some more time in reading some book to understand more about TDD.  

Fortunately, I found a very nice book ["Test-Driven Development by Example"](https://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Kent-Beck/dp/0321146530) written by Kent Beck. In this book, Kent has given one key mantra for TDD **"Red/green/refactor"**. I also found so many techniques, patterns and principles for TDD. 

I decided to build a small Android application with TDD approach. I will try to follow some of the key principles, techniques and patterns which are given in this book. 

You can find AndroidTDD repository on [Github](https://github.com/vsvankhede/AndroidTDD). I'm also using Circle CI server for build and test automation.

**Bonus:** If you are interested only in knowing about some specific techniques or example which I've/ll used for writing Unit and Integration tests in Android then you can find [Android Testing Example](https://github.com/vsvankhede/AndroidTestingExample) repository helpful.
